                <p className="leading-8 content-evenly px-28 text-center text-xl ">Having a regular GP is of utmost importance for several reasons. Firstly, a regular GP is familiar with your medical history, which allows for better continuity of care. They can track your health over time, identify patterns, and make informed decisions about your treatment. Secondly, a regular GP can provide personalised care tailored to your specific needs. They take into account your lifestyle, family history, and individual circumstances to offer the most suitable advice and treatment options. Lastly, having a regular GP ensures that you have a trusted healthcare professional who knows you well and can provide ongoing support and guidance.</p>
